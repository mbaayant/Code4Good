            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to provide students with the resources and information they need to make informed decisions about their education. We aim to help students navigate the complexities of scholarships, financial aid, and cost estimations to make higher education more accessible and affordable.</p>
            <p>This website was created by a group of four students aspiring to study abroad. The resources we compiled on this website are the ones we hope will be useful to every student, including ourselves. We understand the challenges and uncertainties that come with planning for higher education, and our goal is to share the tools and knowledge that have helped us along the way.</p>
            <p>We created this project as part of a school project involving community work. This project provided us with an opportunity to learn, collaborate, and develop a resource that we believe can make a real difference for students everywhere.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting our website. We hope you find the information and tools provided here helpful in your educational journey.</p>
