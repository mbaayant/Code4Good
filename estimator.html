            <h2>What is a Net-College Cost Calculator?</h2>
            <p>
                As per Wikipedia, a college cost calculator, in the United States, is an online tool allowing students and their parents to calculate how much college is likely to cost. Numbers are input into the online calculator, and if done properly, it gives an estimate of the likely expenses for that student attending that particular college.
            </p>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>
                Students and parents can go online to a college's website, find the calculator, and input numbers such as the family's income, the student's grades and test scores, and other information, and the calculator is supposed to provide an estimate of how much it will cost that particular student to go to that particular college.
                <b>It is only an estimate</b> and the accuracy of the estimates will vary depending on factors such as whether parents and students understand the right numbers to input, the simplicity of the tool, and so on. Each college is in charge of developing and maintaining their own calculators.
            </p>
