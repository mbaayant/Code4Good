            <h1>Federal Student Aid</h1>
            <img src="Images/Money.jpg" alt="Photo of Money">
            <p class="caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Kenny Eliason</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/1-us-dollar-banknote-close-up-photography-AOJGuIJkoBc?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></p>
            <h2>Introduction to FAFSA</h2>
            <p>FAFSA® or the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA form, is the application that students complete each year to receive student aid for college or career school.</p>
            <h3>Why FAFSA is Important</h3>
            <p>
                It's important that you fill out the FAFSA form if you want to receive financial aid. The FAFSA form has
                a
                series of questions for you to answer. The information you provide will be used to determine your
                eligibility for federal student aid, and many states will use your information to determine eligibility
                for
                state financial aid. This financial aid may include grants, scholarships, work-study funds, and student
                loans.
            </p>
            <h3>How to Submit Your FAFSA Form</h3>
            <p>
                When you complete the FAFSA form online, you can pick up to 20 schools to receive your information.
                Those
                schools will use the information to calculate how much student aid to offer you. Each school will send
                you
                an aid offer that details the types and amounts of aid available to you.
            </p>
            <h3>The Benefits of Financial Aid</h3>
            <p>
                Financial aid can help you and your family afford college or career school. Submit your FAFSA form to
                access
                the largest source of financial aid—federal student aid—as well as financial aid from your school and
                state.
            </p>
            <h3>Tips for FAFSA Submission</h3>
            <p>Make sure that you complete the form for every year you plan to attend school. You should submit it as
                early
                as possible on or after the day the form launches, to meet state, school, and federal deadlines, and to
                be
                eligible for as much aid as possible.</p>

                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Types of Federal Student Aid</h2>
            <p>There are several types of federal student aid, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Grants:</b> Financial aid that typically doesn't have to be repaid.</li>
                <li><b>Loans:</b> Borrowed money for college or career school; you must repay your loans, with interest.
                </li>
                <li><b>Work-Study:</b> A work program through which you earn money to help you pay for school.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Federal Student Aid Application Process</h2>
            <p>The FAFSA form is the first step to applying for federal student aid. It's free and takes about 30
                minutes to
                complete. Once you submit the form, the U.S. Department of Education will calculate your Expected Family
                Contribution (EFC) to determine your financial need.</p>
            <p>Schools will use this information to create your financial aid package. If you need additional financial
                aid,
                you can explore private scholarships and grants or consider student loans.</p>

            <h2>Federal Student Aid Repayment Plans</h2>
            <p>There are several repayment plans available for federal student loans, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Standard Repayment Plan:</b> Fixed monthly payments for up to 10 years.</li>
                <li><b>Graduated Repayment Plan:</b> Payments start low and increase every two years, up to 10 years.
                </li>
                <li><b>Income-Driven Repayment Plans:</b> Payments based on your income and family size, with possible
                    loan
                    forgiveness after 20-25 years.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Understanding federal student aid and the FAFSA process is crucial to securing the financial support you
                need
                for your education. Make sure to complete the FAFSA form every year, explore all your financial aid
                options,
                and choose a repayment plan that works for you.</p>

            <h1>Net College Cost Calculator</h1>
            <h2>What is a Net-College Cost Calculator?</h2>
            <p>
                As per Wikipedia, a college cost calculator, in the United States, is an online tool allowing students
                and
                their parents to calculate how much college is likely to cost.
                Numbers are input into the online calculator, and if done properly, it gives an estimate of the likely
                expenses for that student attending that particular college.
            </p>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>
                Students and parents can go online to a college's website, find the calculator, and input numbers such
                as
                the family's income, the student's grades and test scores, and other information, and the calculator is
                supposed to provide an estimate of how much it will cost that particular student to go to that
                particular
                college.
                <b>It is only an estimate</b> and the accuracy of the estimates will vary depending on factors such
                as
                whether parents and students understand the right numbers to input, the simplicity of the tool, and so
                on.
                Each college is in charge of developing and maintaining their own calculators.

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to provide students with the resources and information they need to make informed
                decisions
                about their education. We aim to help students navigate the complexities of scholarships, financial aid,
                and
                cost estimations to make higher education more accessible and affordable.</p>
            <p>This website was created by a group of four students aspiring to study abroad. The resources we compiled
                on
                this website are the ones we hope will be useful to every student, including ourselves. We understand
                the
                challenges and uncertainties that come with planning for higher education, and our goal is to share the
                tools and knowledge that have helped us along the way.</p>
            <p>We created this project as part of a beginner-friendly hackathon hosted on Devpost. This hackathon
                provided
                us with an opportunity to learn, collaborate, and develop a resource that we believe can make a real
                difference for students everywhere.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting our website. We hope you find the information and tools provided here helpful in
                your
                educational journey.</p>
