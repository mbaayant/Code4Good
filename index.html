            <h2>Introduction to FAFSA</h2>
            <p>FAFSA® or the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA form, is the application that students complete each year to receive student aid for college or career school.</p>
            <h3>Why FAFSA is Important</h3>
            <p>It's important that you fill out the FAFSA form if you want to receive financial aid. The FAFSA form has a series of questions for you to answer. The information you provide will be used to determine your eligibility for federal student aid, and many states will use your information to determine eligibility for state financial aid. This financial aid may include grants, scholarships, work-study funds, and student loans.</p>
            <h3>How to Submit Your FAFSA Form</h3>
            <p>When you complete the FAFSA form online, you can pick up to 20 schools to receive your information. Those schools will use the information to calculate how much student aid to offer you. Each school will send you an aid offer that details the types and amounts of aid available to you.</p>
            <h3>The Benefits of Financial Aid</h3>
            <p>Financial aid can help you and your family afford college or career school. Submit your FAFSA form to access the largest source of financial aid—federal student aid—as well as financial aid from your school and state.</p>
            <h3>Tips for FAFSA Submission</h3>
            <p>Make sure that you complete the form for every year you plan to attend school. You should submit it as early as possible on or after the day the form launches, to meet state, school, and federal deadlines, and to be eligible for as much aid as possible.</p>
            <h2>Federal Student Aid Eligibility Requirements</h2>
            <p>To qualify for federal student aid, you must:</p>

            <h2>Types of Federal Student Aid</h2>

                <li><b>Work-Study:</b> A work program through which you earn money to help you pay for school.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Federal Student Aid Application Process</h2>
            <p>The FAFSA form is the free application for federal student aid. Submitting your FAFSA form is the first step toward getting federal aid for college or career school. You should submit it as early as possible to meet state, school, and federal deadlines.</p>
